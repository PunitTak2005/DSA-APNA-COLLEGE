# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in C and C++. It is designed to help students, programmers, and competitive coders understand and apply fundamental concepts efficiently.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the programs:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone (https://github.com/PunitTak2005/DSA-APNA-COLLEGE)
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```sh
   cd dsa-repo/Arrays
   ```
3. Compile and run a program:
   ```sh
   gcc sorting.c -o sorting && ./sorting
   ```
