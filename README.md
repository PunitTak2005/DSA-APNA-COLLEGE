Data Structures (DS)
Data structures are specialized formats used to store and manage data efficiently. They determine how data is arranged, accessed, and modified. Some fundamental types include:

Arrays: Fixed-size sequential storage for elements of the same type.

Linked Lists: Dynamic structures where elements (nodes) point to the next one.

Stacks: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structures used in function calls and undo operations.

Queues: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structures used in scheduling and buffering.

Trees: Hierarchical structures like binary trees, BSTs, and AVL trees.

Graphs: Networked data representation for complex relationships.

Hash Tables: Key-value storage allowing fast access and retrieval.

Algorithms (A)
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems efficiently. Common algorithm types include:

Sorting: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc., for organizing data.

Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search, etc., for retrieving information.

Recursion & Backtracking: Solving problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems (e.g., Tower of Hanoi, N-Queens).

Greedy Algorithms: Finding optimal solutions by choosing the best immediate option (e.g., Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm).

Dynamic Programming: Breaking problems into overlapping subproblems and solving them efficiently (e.g., Fibonacci Series, Knapsack Problem).

Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for shortest paths and traversal.

Importance of DSA
Enhances problem-solving skills.

Improves efficiency in coding and system design.

Essential for competitive programming and coding interviews.

Forms the foundation of software development, databases, and AI.

Mastering DSA is crucial for becoming a proficient programmer, as it helps build optimized and scalable applications. ðŸš€
